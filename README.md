# gyroscope_keyboard_control
***WORK IN PROGRESS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK*** Code to run on an arduino uno that has been re-flashed as a hid device (http://wiki.sgmk-ssam.ch/index.php?title=Arduino_Uno_R3_as_HID http://mitchtech.net/arduino-usb-hid-keyboard/) to send keypresses from wrist/other extremity movements. Based on some code for an arduino-powered segway.

To use: upload the code and flash the arduino as a keyboard and run. Right now not working properly (I am looking for the correct HID keycodes for arrow keys) so do not attempt to run without fixing it.
